            system, serving as an advance collection mechanism for various
            taxes. It requires businesses to deduct tax at source from certain
            types of payments and remit it directly to the Kenya Revenue
            Authority (KRA).

            <i className="fas fa-info-circle"></i> What is Withholding Tax?
          </h2>

          <p>
            Withholding Tax is a mechanism where businesses deduct tax at source
            from certain payments and remit it directly to KRA on behalf of the
            recipient. The deducted tax is either a final tax or a credit
            against the recipient's total tax liability.
          </p>

          <p>There are two main types of Withholding Tax in Kenya:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Withholding Tax as a Final Tax:</strong> The tax deducted
              is the final tax liability on that income, and the recipient
              doesn't need to include it in their tax return.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Withholding Tax as an Advance Tax:</strong> The tax
              deducted is credited against the recipient's total tax liability
              for the year, and they can claim a refund if too much tax was
              withheld.
            </li>
          </ol>

            <p>
              Withholding Tax serves two main purposes: it ensures regular
              revenue flow to the government throughout the year, and it expands
              the tax net by capturing income that might otherwise go
              unreported.
